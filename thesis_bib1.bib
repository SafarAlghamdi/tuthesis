In this paper, the propagation of premixed flames in two-dimensional channels of variable width with a prescribed Poiseuille flow is discussed. The main objective is to assess the effects of differential diffusion on the burning process. For both thick (narrow channels) and thin (wide channels) flames, explicit asymptotic results are obtained for the burning rate and flame shape. These are complemented with numerical calculations spanning the remaining range of moderate flame thicknesses. The results show that unlike thin flames, known to be affected by the effective Lewis number of the mixture, in narrow channels Lewis number effects are negligible. Furthermore, in wide channels, not only does the burning rate strongly depend on the Lewis number, but flame tipopening or dead-space near thewall may result in mixtures with a Lewis number sufficiently less than one.",

A modeled transport equation for the joint pdf of velocity and the reaction progress variable is solved by a Monte Carlo method. Detailed calculations of flame properties and flow statistics, including the flame speed, the scalar flux, the turbulence intensities, the kinetic energy budget and conditional statistics are presented for different density ratios. Results are compared with the limited available experimental data and the calculations based on the Bray-Moss-Libby (BML) model. Compared to the BML model, the present pdf approach has several advantages: fewer processes have to be modeled, more information can be extracted from the solution, and the method is directly applicable to multidimensional flames. },

In this paper, the propagation of premixed flames in two-dimensional channels of variable width with a prescribed Poiseuille flow is discussed. The main objective is to assess the effects of differential diffusion on the burning process. For both thick (narrow channels) and thin (wide channels) flames, explicit asymptotic results are obtained for the burning rate and flame shape. These are complemented with numerical calculations spanning the remaining range of moderate flame thicknesses. The results show that unlike thin flames, known to be affected by the effective Lewis number of the mixture, in narrow channels Lewis number effects are negligible. Furthermore, in wide channels, not only does the burning rate strongly depend on the Lewis number, but flame tipopening or dead-space near thewall may result in mixtures with a Lewis number sufficiently less than one.",
