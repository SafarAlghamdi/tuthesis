\section{Introduction}
Premixed flame propagation in a flow field is a fundamental problem in combustion theory with applications in many practical combustion devices. The problem is characterised by the interaction of curved flame with a flow that can involve several length and velocity scales, as can be seen in turbulent combustion. This multiscale nature of the problem, coupled with the presence of several interlinked processes such as diffusion and reaction, has a significant impact on the flame characteristics such as its shape and propagation speed.
