We have examined in this thesis the effect of prescribed flow fields on the propagation of three distinct types of flame namely flame balls, premixed flames and triple flames. In general, the main aim was to assess the influence of the flow on some of the characteristics of these flames such as flame structure, propagation speed and stability. The current investigation has been restricted to prescribed flows within the constant-density approximation, neglecting the effect of thermal expansion. The study of the flame-flow interaction has been based on asymptotic analyses and numerical simulations of the thermo-diffusive models. We summarise in the following the main findings for each of these flames along with recommendations for future work.
