Flame propagation in a flow field is a fundamental problem in combustion theory with a wide range of practical applications. The problem is characterised by the presence of different kinds of interlinked inhomogeneities that are inherited not only from the combustion process itself but also from the flow field. These inhomogeneities include the spatial and temporal non-uniformities of the flow field and the spatial non-uniformities in the enthalpy of the reactants. These inhomogeneities have significant implications for the structure, propagation and stability of flames.
